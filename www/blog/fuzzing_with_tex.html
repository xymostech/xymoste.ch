        <h1>Fuzzing with TeX or: Rounding is hard</h1>
        <time datetime="2025-01-01">January 1st, 2025</time>

        <p>This is (hopefully) the first in a series of longer articles I'm going
        to write about building <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xymostech/XymosTeX">XymosTeX</a>,
        my from-scratch implementation of TeX in Rust. I've traditionally written some

        which detail the project as I go along, but sometimes the scope of work
        that I have to do is too long for a commit messsage, so I figure it
        would be fun and maybe interesting to write a blog post when that happens.</p>

        <p>Funnily enough, that last commit that I linked to ends with the statement:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I will eventually get around to fixing the issue of Dimens needing to
          be rounded as well.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Well, that time is now! What I'm going to talk about is my adventure in
        figuring out how to correctly round dimensions in TeX. I ended up
        arriving at this place in a rather roundabout way though, which is part
        of why I found this adventure so fun.</p>

        <p>Let's start out with the current state of the XymosTeX project. As of
        writing, I'm working through the rules which govern breaking long
        paragraphs into individual, justified lines. This process is complex and
        has many rules, but the result is often a very nicely formatted
        paragraph. For fun, I've enabled justification on the paragraphs in this
        blog post as an example of your browser's attempt at performing this
        justification.</p>

        <p>Most recently, I was attempting to make a small change to how the
        breakpoints for the lines in a paragraph were chosen. The actual change
        I was making isn't super important but it was a very subtle change (in
        terms of how often it affects how the paragraphs look) which is what
        ended up sending me down the rabbit hole that was the inspiration for
        this blog post.</p>

        <p>
          <details>
            <summary>More info on the actual change</summary>
            <p>
              When choosing line breaks, TeX is essentially performing a graph
              search where the nodes are potential breakpoints (like spaces) and
              the edges are the potential lines between those breakpoints. Each
              breakpoint stores the "cost" of getting to that breakpoint from
              the beginning of the paragraph where the cost is a calculation of
              how "bad" the paragraph will look. There is a special kind of
              "badness" calculation that can occur where TeX looks at bordering
              pairs of lines and if one of them is stretched out but the other
              one is squeezed tight it adds some extra "badness" to the second
              line.
            </p>

            <p>
              I discovered that in some cases if there are multiple possible
              lines ending in the same place but one of them is a stretched out
              line and one is a squeezed tight line, TeX will keep track of both
              of them when looking for the next line to make instead of just
              picking the one with the immediate least "badness". In normal
              paragraphs the lines are usually rarely squeezed or stretched
              very much so this doesn't end up happening very often which is
              why the change is fairly subtle.
            </p>
          </details>
        </p>

        <p>
          So, after I had made my change, I was fairly confident that it worked
          as I intended but I wanted to be sure that my change was correct. It
          was difficult to manually find edge cases where this affected the
          output, so I decided to do something that I haven't done very much in
          this project: compare my output to the output from actual TeX. And
          because it was hard to find edge cases, I decided to test this against
          a *bunch* of different cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          I whipped up a quick <code>fuzz.sh</code> script to do this.
          Thankfully I already had built tools which could very accurately
          compare the output from my code and TeX. I set it up to test the
          output of the same paragraph split at many different widths and with
          slight tweaks to a few of the parameters which govern the breaking.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Why is it non-trivial to compare the output?</summary>
          <p>
            The output format of both my project and TeX is called a "dvi" file.
            It's similar to a PDF file in that it contains the contents of pages
            with each element (like a character) laid out in absolute
            coordinates.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could compare two DVI files byte-for-byte, but that doesn't end up
            with a very useful comparison, partially because there is usually
            differing metadata but also because there are multiple ways to
            represent the same final output. For instance, if I want to put the
            letter "a" at the coordinates (50, 100), a DVI file that says "move
            right 50", "move down 100", "print 'a'" and one that says "move down
            100", "move right 50", "print 'a'" will produce the same output, but
            will differ from each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, I have written a tool which "interprets" the DVI file, and spits
            out the exact coordinates of each of the characters in the file. If
            I compare this, even if the DVI files arrive at the same output in
            different ways, I can be sure that the final output (i.e. what the
            user sees) will be the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an even deeper sidenote: The instructions for the canonical
            "test" of TeX itself, TRIP.TEX, specify that these differences are
            allowed and don't invalidate my goal of trying to create an
            implementation of TeX.
            <a href="https://texdoc.org/serve/tripman.pdf/0">In particular, it says:</a>
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The resulting file should agree with the master TRIP.TYP file of
              step 0, except that some of the values might be a little off due
              to floating-point rounding discrepancies. Furthermore there may be
              differences between 'right' and 'w' and 'x' commands, and
              between 'down' and 'y' and 'z'; the key thing is that all
              characters and rules and xxx 's should be in almost the same
              positions as specified in Appendix F. (If your DVI-writing
              routines differ substantially from those in TEX.WEB, you may want
              to write a DVIcompare program that detects any substantive
              differences between two given DVI files. Such a routine would be
              of general use besides. On the other hand, if you have set dvi buf
              size to 800, then your DVI file should be virtually identical to
              the one supplied.)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </details>

        <p>
          I ran it, heart full of optimism, ready to prove that I was an
          excellent TeXnician, and... it failed on the very first test case.
          Oof. I rushed to compare them visually, side by side, to see why my
          line breaking had failed, and... it looked correct? Very odd. I double
          checked that I was looking at the correct output, ran my test again,
          and found that indeed, the line breaking was actually working great.
          But for some reason, the exact output was sliiiiiightly off. After a
          bunch of manual diffing, I discovered that the incorrectly positioned
          elements were off from the correct values by between 1 and 10 scaled
          points.
        </p>

        <p>
          For reference, a scaled point is 1/65,536th of a "point", which is
          itself ~1/72nd of an inch, or ~1/28th of a cm. So being off by 10
          scaled points means being off by 1/500,000th of an inch. No wonder I
          wasn't able to see the error when I was comparing visually!
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point, I knew that some of the elements were in the wrong
          place, but I wasn't exactly sure which ones. The tiny amount of
          difference made me very suspicious that I was simply rounding
          something incorrectly, and some of my 
          <a href="https://github.com/xymostech/XymosTeX/commit/0f1fcfb62c3e12b7b7f441c43962ff51cb390e40#diff-7f32f2a87febc2bf043f4b5fd34f442a4d7476371edae2dcaa0502a5427330e1L96">
            previous encounters with rounding numbers in TeX</a>
          told me that there were a few places ripe for the picking just by
          looking at the current calculations that I was making. In particular,
          anywhere that I was using a floating point number to do a calculation
          was already suspect as I was fairly confident that TeX itself doesn't
          use floating point numbers anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the first places I started tinkering was in what I call the
          "glue set ratio", which is a number representing how much the spaces
          in a line should stretch or shrink. This was a calculation that I was
          doing a lot of during the line breaking step, and though it was not
          using floating point calculations, I was worried that it was doing the
          integer division in the wrong step so I was rounding incorrectly.
          Tweaking this made some of the errors go away, but not all of them.
          Back to square 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          I then went and looked at my calculation of dimensions and remembered
          that some of the division calculations between two dimensions were
          using floating point. I tried changing that to use integers, which
          required a few changes in other places. And after running... still
          there were errors. At this point, I realized that going about this
          haphazardly wasn't going to solve the issue. I needed to know what was
          actually going wrong, and I needed a specific plan to fix it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To figure out the actual issue, I needed to know exactly which of the
          elements were actually getting positioned incorrectly. Luckily, I
          already had a plan for this, based off of an experiment I had done a
          few years ago. When I was first testing out rendering to DVI files, I
          had whipped up some javascript which used the output of my script
          which spits out the locations of elements in the file and used that to
          render the DVI files in the browser. I figured if I recreated that
          experiment but added in some debugging information I could pinpoint
          the elements that were causing issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, <a href="https://tex-tools.xymoste.ch/dvi-rendering">a website</a>
          was born. Even with this extremely basic debugging tool, I could
          finally identify exactly what was going wrong. And identify I did! It
          turned out, that the elements that seemed to be rounded incorrectly
          weren't randomly scattered throughout the whole output, they were
          clustered into individual lines. So of the 8 lines in the output, all
          of the wrong elements would be in 1 or 2 of those. Very suspicious.
        </p>

        <p>
          And here's where I started actually strategizing about how to fix
          this. I expected that there was a rounding error in my code, so
          instead of trying to tweak my code, I just started doing the
          calculations I expected TeX to be doing manually inside of a Python
          Jupyter notebook. That way, if I got the right answers in the
          notebook, I could compare it to my code and see where my code went
          wrong. My calculations would look something like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code><span class="comment"># \a = \hbox to20pt{x}</span>
            <span class="comment"># {\a\a\a\a} {\a\a} {\a\a\a} {\a\a\a} {\a\a} {\a\a\a\a} {\a}</span>
            total_space = 410 <span class="comment"># in pt</span>
            box_space = (4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 1) * 20 <span class="comment"># in pt</span>
            non_box_space = (total_space - box_space) * 65536 <span class="comment"># in sp</span>
            num_spaces = 6
            spaces_space = num_spaces * 218453 <span class="comment"># 3.3333pt in sp</span>
            stretch = non_box_space - spaces_space
            space_stretch = 109226 * num_spaces <span class="comment"># 1.6666pt in sp</span>
            stretch_amount = stretch * 65536 // space_stretch

            <span class="comment"># calculate position of 5th box (4 boxes and 1 space in)</span>
            box_pos = 4 * 20 * 65536 + 1 * 218453 + 1 * 109226 * stretch_amount // 65536</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          I would plug in the numbers that I was expecting and I would compare
          it to the correct results and... I got the wrong answers! The
          calculations I was doing in the Python notebook <strong>also</strong>
          were wrong! At this point I was very confused but also very glad I had
          started to debug this way. From there, I could rapidly iterate on the
          calculation in my notebook and check the numbers against the TeX
          output without having to try to fix my code.
        </p>

        <p>
          After hours and hours of tweaking my calculations and staring
          befuddled at the tiny differences in numbers, I finally found the two
          clues that helped me solve the mystery. Both of them were fascinating
          to discover and understand. The first: TeX was using a different form
          of rounding than the 'default' behavior in some languages. And the
          second: TeX was actually doing additional compensation for some of the
          rounding errors!
        </p>

        <p>
          The first clue: rounding methods. Before I delved down this rabbit
          hole, I knew that there were multiple ways to round things. After all,
          things like floor and ceiling were used frequently in many algorithms.
          A fun question to answer: what kind of rounding is done when I perform
          simple integer division? The answer: in Rust this is round to zero,
          but in Python this is round to negative infinity! These strategies are
          different for negative numbers, so even taking a strategy that worked
          in Python might not have worked if I directly ported it into Rust. And
          now the question: which one do I want to be using? One of those two?
          Something more complex, like
          <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html#method.div_euclid">
            Euclidian division</a>?
          After much pulling of hairs, I've found that I actually want two
          different strategies. I used round to negative infinity (i.e.
          flooring) when I was calculating dimensions, but I ended up needing to
          use founding to nearest (i.e. 1/2 rounds to 1, 1/3 rounds to 0) when
          actually generating the DVI file output. I'm not sure why both of
          those are needed, but it seems to work!
        </p>

        <p>
          The second clue: rounding compensation! When the amount of stretch or
          shrink for the spaces is calculated, I realized that due to rounding,
          sometimes there would be extra space left over. For instance, if you
          had a line that was supposed to be 100pt wide but tried filling it
          with spaces that were 19pt, you'd end up with 5 spaces and 5pt left
          over. Previously, I was just discarding this extra space. The error
          tended to be miniscule (again, on the order of 1/100,000ths of
          inches), but apparently TeX was accounting for that! To account for
          this, as I am laying out elements in the generated DVI file, I would
          need to keep a running tally of how far into a given line I am and add
          in tiny extra spaces to account for the lost space.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, I took my new learnings, implemented it into the code, and finally
          got back to running my fuzzing script. I was nervous but I fired it
          up. And... it worked! Every single computed output 
          <strong>exactly</strong> matched what TeX was giving me! I even
          expanded my fuzzing script to throw even more wild parameters at my
          implementation and it kept working. I was so relieved that I had
          figured it out. Not only did this validate that my new rounding
          calculations were working, but I also finally got validation that the
          original change I was trying to make was working as well!
        </p>

        <p>
          All that was left to do was add innumerable tests and bundle up these
          fixes into a series of wild commits. This took several months to
          figure out, test, and finally get committed. Now onto whatever
          challege this project throws up next!
