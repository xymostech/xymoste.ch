        <h1>Calculating Pi on a Business Card using TeX</h1>
        <time datetime="2019-04-08">April 8th, 2019</time>

        <p>I've seen a trend recently about putting some fun piece of code on the
        back of a business card. For no reason in particular, I decided that I
        wanted to do something similar! And since I've been sinking a bunch of my
        time into TeX recently, I decided to implement something in TeX.</p>

        <p>TeX can't (or at least makes it really hard to) do anything like make
        an interactive game or spit out fancy bitmap raytraced graphics, so I had
        to come up with something that was mostly text-based. I remembered a
        recent post on Pi day about Google calculating some ridiculous number of
        digits of Pi, so I thought there might be some simple algorithms for
        calculating pi. Also, TeX doesn't really have easy support for floating
        point numbers, so something that only does integer arithmetic would be
        ideal.</p>

        <p>Pretty quickly, I learned about
        a <a href="http://iwriteiam.nl/SigProgC.html#pi">tiny C program</a> that
        Dik T. Winter wrote to calculate digits of pi. It only used integer math,
        so it seemed like a good fit for what I was looking for! After doing some
        deobfuscation and then doing some digging, I eventually
        found
        <a href="http://dept.cs.williams.edu/~heeringa/classes/cs135/s15/readings/spigot.pdf">a good description</a>
        of the algorithm that it was using.</p>

        <p>With the algorithm in hand, I started implementing. Unfortunately, I
        ran into a snag immediately: the original algorithm used a really big
        array (with more than 3 times the number of spaces as digits you want
        to calculate) to store intermediate remainders as it was calculating,
        but TeX doesn't have the concept of arrays. There are a static number
        of variable registers (in plain TeX, 256) that could be used as an
        array, but that would only let me calculate about 70 digits of pi. I
        decided that that's how it was going to go and started implementing the
        rest of the algorithm, using the registers as the array.</p>

        <p>Things came together nicely. There was basically one big loop to
        calculate the final product, and then a few helper macros to do things
        like calculate remainders and add some formatting (The original program
        spits out &#8220;31415926...&#8221; but I wanted it to actually show
        &#8220;3.1415926&#8221; with the decimal point). I eventually got
        things working, and it was pretty cool! TeX, a markup language with no
        floating point numbers, was calculating decimal digits of an irrational
        number.</p>

        <p>However, I wasn't terribly satisfied with the result. I wanted to be
        able to calculate an arbitrary number of digits of pi and not be
        limited by the number of registers available. I thought about the
        different kinds of values in TeX, and decided that &#8220;token
        lists&#8221;, which could store (almost) unlimited amounts of token
        characters, could probably be retrofitted to store unlimited numbers of
        integers. So, I set out to build a real array.</p>

        <p>Actually, I figured that due to how the algorithm works, I didn't
        need the full indexing power of an array. Since the algorithm linearly
        traverses the array and just edits the one value that it's looking at,
        I could make do with 2 stacks: I'd pop values off of one stack and then
        push the new values onto the second stack. Then, after each iteration
        I'd replace the (empty) first stack with the new second stack. Building
        a stack using token lists turned out to be fairly straightforwards:</p>

        <p>First, we create <code>\currlist</code> and <code>\nextlist</code> as aliases for two token list registers:</p>

        <pre><code>  \newtoks\currlist
  \newtoks\nextlist</code></pre>

        <p>We're going to store our lists like <code>;&lt;number&gt;;&lt;number&gt;;&lt;number&gt;;:</code>. This allows us to distinguish the different values, as well as tell where the end of the list is.</p>

        <p>Our first macro pops a value off of <code>\currlist</code> and places it in the variable pass in as <code>#1</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>  \def\popcurr #1{%
    \expandafter\popcurrinner
      \the\currlist
      {#1}%
  }</code></pre>

        <p>We're effectively passing the current value
        of <code>\currlist</code> and the variable we want to be setting to the
        macro that does the real work, <code>\popcurrinner</code>. We have to
        use <code>\expandafter</code> to get TeX to
        expand <code>\the\currlist</code> to its value (instead of just passing
        the literal tokens <code>\the</code> and <code>\currlist</code>).</p>

        <p>Now we write that inner macro. Using the power of parameter
        expansion, we can pull out the first value from the list (which is
        recognized by the ; surrounding it) as <code>#1</code>, store it in the
        appropriate variable (which is now <code>#3</code>), and then finally
        set <code>\currlist</code> to be the remainder of the
        list, <code>#2</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>  \def\popcurrinner ;#1;#2:#3{%
    % Store the first value in #3
    #3=#1%
    % Set the new \currlist
    \currlist={;#2:}%
  }</code></pre>

        <p>The last thing we need is the ability to push to our lists. This is
        relatively simple, but we have to use a bunch
        of <code>\expandafter</code> to get things to evaluate correctly. This
        is the function for pushing to <code>\currlist</code>, and there's an
        analagous one for <code>\nextlist</code>. Since we're never popping
        from <code>\nextlist</code>, this is all we need.</p>

        <pre><code>  \def\pushcurr #1{%
    \expandafter\currlist\expandafter=\expandafter{%
      \the\currlist
      #1%
    }%
  }</code></pre>

        <p>Armed with our new infinite stack abilities, we can now calculate as
        many digits of pi as we want! For the final design I put on my business
        card, I calculated just enough digits to fill up the back of a business
        card, and then printed a couple business cards with the generated
        output on the back instead of the code.</p>

        <p>I had to minify the code to fit on a business card, so the resulting
        code isn't terribly understandable, but that's okay. Hopefully nobody
        tries to actually read it off of the business card anyways!</p>
