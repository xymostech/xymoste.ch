      <h1>My famous Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li class="ingredient-header">Dry ingredients:</li>
        <li>289g All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp Cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li class="ingredient-header">Wet ingredients:</li>
        <li>6 oz browned butter</li>
        <li>170g dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li class="ingredient-header">Chocolate:</li>
        <li>120g Milk Chocolate wafers</li>
        <li>144g Semisweet Chocolate wafers</li>
        <li>Semisweet Chocolate chips</li>
        <li class="ingredient-header">Miscellaneous:</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p>Whisk together the dry ingredients.</p>
      <p>Beat together the melted butter and sugars until well combined and
      slightly lightened in color. Add the eggs one at a time and beat until
      combined. Continue beating until lightened in color. Mix in the vanilla
      extract.</p>
      <p>Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and slowly mix
      until just combined. Add the second half and slowly mix until mostly
      combined, with some flour still visible.</p>
      <p>Fold in the chocolate wafers (but not the chips!).</p>
      <p>Refrigerate dough overnight.</p>
      <p>Preheat oven to 350&deg;.</p>
      <p>Measure out 55g balls of cookie dough and place on a parchment-lined
      baking sheet. Sprinkle a pinch of flaky sea salt onto each ball.</p>
      <p>Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes, until the peaks of the cookies appear
      golden brown.</p>
      <p>As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, push 3-4 chocolate chips
      into the top. (This is mostly to make them look better).</p>
      <p>Transfer cookies to a cooling rack when they are sturdy, and let cool
      for ~10 minutes before eating.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>Many of the ingredients are listed by weight. This is because it's
      hard to get a consistent recipe if you're measuring by volume, especially
      with things like flour and chocolate! Use a kitchen scale to make things
      easy and consistent.</p>

      <p>To brown butter, start with ~10 oz of unsalted butter. Melt this in a
      saucepan and continue heating until it starts bubbling. Watch the butter
      and occasionally stir. Eventually, the bubbling will somewhat subside.
      Now, continually stir and watch the color of the milk solids floating
      around, they should slowly turn from whitish to golden brown to dark
      brown. Remove the butter from the heat when they reach dark brown, almost
      black. Strain to remove the milk solids, or let settle and pour off the
      top. Let cool before using in the recipe to prevent cooking the eggs.</p>

      <p>Allowing the dough to rest overnight helps hydrate everything and
      lets the flavors infuse, which makes things more delicious!</p>

      <p>Getting good chocolate for cookies is hard. I've found that using flat
      shaped chocolate chips provides a better taste, and makes delicious
      layers. I use Guittard's baking wafers:
